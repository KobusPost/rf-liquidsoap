---
# 1. Our context

## 1.4. Liquidsoap in Radio France cloud based environment

### 1.4.1. We use Liquidsoap like a real time pipeline for audio:

- raw inputs, coming from out studios
- buffers
- encoding: AAC & MP3, multiple qualities
- output: icecast & hls
- monitoring and operations over sources

```
~~~graph-easy --as=boxart
[inputs] - SRT -> [source selection] - encoding -> [mp3, aac] - streaming -> [icecast, hls]
~~~
```

---
# 1. Our context

## 1.4. Liquidsoap in Radio France cloud based environment

### 1.4.2. We stream the audio we receive as is

- No playlist
- No audio transitions
- No advanced audio processing/filters or normalization for now

---
# 1. Our context

## 1.4. Liquidsoap in Radio France cloud based environment

### 1.4.3. We kept it simple

For one livestream -> (at least) one Liquidsoap process

Keeping the latency introduced by the pipeline as low as possible.

> *Most of the latency is introduced by the streaming protocols: Icecast,
> HLS...*

# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.1. A standard production environment

What's needed for a real time audio streaming production?

![basic.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radiofrance/rf-liquidsoap/master/.res/basic.png)

---
# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.1. A standard production environment

### 2.1.1. Achieving **input** resilience (1/3)

A self switching input fallback mechanism

```liquidsoap
radio_prod = fallback(
  id="fallback_prod",
  track_sensitive=false,
  [
    ...
  ]
)
```

---
# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.1. A standard production environment

### 2.1.1. Achieving **input** resilience (2/3)

Protect stream continuity at all cost to avoid client disconnection, with a
`safe_blank` source

```liquidsoap
radio_prod = fallback(
  id="fallback_prod",
  track_sensitive=false,
  [
    ...
    (safe_blank:source(audio=pcm,video=none,midi=none))
  ]
)
```

---
# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.1. A standard production environment

### 2.1.1. Achieving **input** resilience (3/3)

Multiple paths for the audio coming from the studios

```liquidsoap
input_list = [
  {name="voieA_caller1", is_autofallback=true, port=10000},
  {name="voieA_caller2", is_autofallback=true, port=10001},
  {name="voieB_caller1", is_autofallback=true, port=10002},
  {name="voieB_caller2", is_autofallback=true, port=10003},
  {name="override_caller1", is_autofallback=false, port=10004},
  {name="override_caller2", is_autofallback=false, port=10005},
  {name="sat_sat1", is_autofallback=true, port=10006},
]
```

---
# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.1. A standard production environment

### 2.1.2. Achieving **output** resilience

#### Multiple Liquidsoap instances per station you stream

*Useful for Liquidsoap resilience*

eg. 2 production servers, 2 preprod servers,
one instance of Liquidsoap per channel, replicated on every server.

That way, you can perform maintainances or script modifications without
service disruption

#### Multiple streaming servers and protocols

*Useful for accessibility, loadbalancing, SLA...*

- Icecast: Icecast master/relay architecture
- HLS: using CDN or cache mechanisms

---
# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.1. A standard production environment

### 2.1.3. Observability on Liquidsoap

- Service availability (*Is Liquidsoap running?*)
- Input status (*Do we receive our audio sources?*)
- Output status (*Can we produce audio?*)
- Logs
- Network metrics (*Bandwidth usage, latency, jitter...*)
- System metrics (*CPU, memory...*)
- Pipeline metrics (*Buffers, latency, clocks...*)
- Audio metrics (*LUFS levels, is the audio blank?*)

# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.1. A standard production environment

### 2.1.4. Tools for operators (1/6)

> An API to **get** information about Liquidsoap state:

Liquidsoap's Harbor HTTP API

https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/harbor_http.html

```liquidsoap
harbor.http.register(port=harbor_http_port, method="GET", "^/readiness$", handler(get_readiness, "GET"))
harbor.http.register(port=harbor_http_port, method="GET", "^/livesource$", handler(get_livesource, "GET"))
```

---
# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.1. A standard production environment

### 2.1.4. Tools for operators (2/6)

> An API to **get** information about Liquidsoap state:

```liquidsoap
def write_http_response(code, data) =
  http.response(code=code, headers=[("Content-Type", "application/json")], data=data)
end

def handler(h, method) =
  def response(~protocol, ~data, ~headers, uri) =
    let (code, data) = h(protocol, data, headers, uri)
    log.info(label="httplog", "#{code} #{method} #{uri}")
    log.debug(label="httplog", "#{code} #{method} #{uri} - #{data}")
    write_http_response(code, data)
  end
  response
end
```

  real = json.stringify(!real_live_source)
  blank = json.stringify(!is_blank)
  (
    200,
    '{"preferred_output": #{preferred}, "inputs": #{inputs}, "real_output": #{real}, "is_output_blank": #{blank}}'
  )
end
```

  if not list.exists(fun (s) -> s.name == data, input_sources) then
    (400, '{"error_message": "input #{data} does not exist"}')
  else
    preferred_live_source := data
    # write livesourcestate on disk to persist across restart
    ignore(
      file.write(data=data, append=false, perms=0o644, livesource_state_path)
    )
    (200, '{"preferred_output": #{json.stringify(data)}}')
  end
end
```

# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.2. A "cloud native" environment

### 2.2.1. Works without human interactions

> The stack should work without needing human interactions.

- Autofallback loop in Liquidsoap (*as shown previously*)
- Initial state should be the nominal running state
- Autorestart on failure

# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.2. A "cloud native" environment

### 2.2.2. Using standard tools around Liquidsoap (1/2)

[Metrics: Prometheus]
[Dashboards: Grafana]
[Alerts: Alertmanager]
[Logs: Stdout + Vector/Filebeat to centralize logs...]
~~~
```

# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.2. A "cloud native" environment

### 2.2.2. Using standard tools around Liquidsoap (2/2)

Liquidsoap includes a Mirage Prometheus server.

```liquidsoap
settings.prometheus.server.set(true)
settings.prometheus.server.port.set(6001)

# Metric definition
audit_lufs_metric_create = prometheus.gauge(
  labels=["radio", "type", "name"],
  help="Audio LUFS Analysis",
  "liquidsoap_output_lufs_5s"
)

# Metric instance
set_metric_audio_lufs =
  audit_lufs_metric_create(label_values=[radio_name,"output", "radio_prod"])

# Source processing
radio_prod = lufs(window=5., radio_prod)

# Update value
thread.run(every=5., {set_metric_audio_lufs(radio_prod.lufs())})
```

---
# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.2. A "cloud native" environment

### 2.2.3. Industrialization, templating and reproductibility (1/2)

Splitting Liquidsoap configuration in parts improves readability:

```text
  scripts/
     00-live.liq        # <-- this is the entrypoint
     10-settings.liq
     20-prometheus.liq
     30-formats.liq
     40-icecast.liq
     50-hls.liq
     60-core.liq
     90-http.liq
```

In `00-live.liq`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/liquidsoap

%include "10-settings.liq"
%include "20-prometheus.liq"
%include "30-formats.liq"
%include "40-icecast.liq"
%include "50-hls.liq"
%include "60-core.liq"
```

---
# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.2. A "cloud native" environment

### 2.2.3. Industrialization, templating and reusability (2/2)

You can make your multipart main script reusable and personalized at runtime
with variables for each livestream you want to build (each Liquidsoap service
you need to run):

```text
  scripts/
  config/
     fip.liq
     franceculture.liq
     franceinter.liq
```

`liquidsoap -c /config/fip.liq /scripts/00-live.liq`

This is a good way to achieve something close to many industrialization tools
like `ansible`, `chef`, `puppet`: a template folder + inventory splitting,
improving readability, scalability and reusability.

If you have too many variables, you could even use an external templating tool
like `jinja2`, `jsonnet` to generate your inventory.

---
# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.2. A "cloud native" environment

### 2.2.4. Version control, release management, lifecycle, integration

It's always a good practice to:
- use versionning (like git)
- describe a specific version of a component with name, tag or release version

```
~~~graph-easy --as=boxart
[version 1.0.0: Major feature... ]
[version 1.0.1: Bugfix... ]
[version 1.1.0: Minor feature... ]
~~~
```

Liquidsoap scripts/templates can be seen like a piece of software, with
it's own lifecycle and requirements.

Taking profit from common industrialization tools to implement continuous
integration, continuous deployment, gitops, etc.

Using variables and/or a separated inventory makes it easy!

---
# 2. Requirements for a Liquidsoap based streaming platform

## 2.2. A "cloud native" environment

### 2.2.5. Containers?

Processing an audio livestream with Liquidsoap is almost stateful.

We can find some ideas for mitigation with multiple parallel liquidsoap process
but...

- Process interruption == output discontinuity
- Sample level synchronization?
- Discontinuity in encoder level containers / output codec containers?

> Not the best for `Kubernetes` or other containerized failable platforms, but
> still doable!

It is still interesting to use `containers`:

- Manipulation of the Liquidsoap scripts as an artifact or a volume
- Variable values can be set in the environment or in a volume
- Easy versionning of Liquidsoap
- Easy to manipulate system dependencies (`ffmpeg` and other libraries...)
- Easy to upgrade, rollback, tests in isolation...
- Reproductibility

# 2147483647. Future, conclusions and Q&A

Room for some improvements:

- Variable naming
- Liquidsoap script organization
- More templating, maybe for a more *common* usage
- Extensive documentation
- Known issues (see `CHANGELOG.md`)
- New Grafana dashboards
- Inform Tony I'm using https://datafruits.fm to feed my examples *before* the
  presentation. Sorry Tony...!

Still missing:

- `.github-ci.yml` and tests on Github (we were using Gitlab for now)
- Finish `docker-compose.yml` for alerts & cadvisor
- `CHANGELOG.md` automation
- Github Stars
