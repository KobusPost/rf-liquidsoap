This project contains the [Liquidsoap](https://www.Liquidsoap.info/) scripts
used at [Radio France](https://radiofrance.fr) in production to produce
multi-sourced resilient [HLS](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/) and
[Icecast](https://icecast.org/) streams.

It includes a demo monitoring stack for metrics, alerts and dashboards, based on
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/),
[Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) and
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/). This stack is a simplified version of the one
we use in our production environments.

An example station implementation called `myradio` is provided, using other
online radios as SRT sources. At Radio France, those SRT sources are coming from
our studios. Each Liquidsoap process (supposedly one per station) is fed
multiple times with the same audio content coming from different network paths,
which allows us to be resilient and to perform maintenances without service
interruptions.

## Design

![Basic implementation architecture](.res/basic.png)

For each station (sometimes called "radio" in this repository), a Liquidsoap
process will consume a set of active/fallback SRT sources to produce a single
output stream called `radio_prod`. In the eventuallity the current preferred SRT
source should fail, `radio_prod` will fallback to the next available source.
Some sources can be excluded from the autofallback loop, waiting for a manual
switch.

The output stream `radio_prod` is encoded multiple times with different encoders
and with multiple quality profiles. We provide some encoder settings as
"profiles" in the [common Liquidsoap script](scripts/formats/) (mp3, aac,
libfdk-aac...)

After the encoding, there are two output methods running in parallel:

- Icecast: Liquidsoap connects as a source to an icecast server and pushes audio

- HLS: adaptative / rolling playlists and audio segments are created locally and
  can be served by a simple HTTP server like NGINX. There is a purge mechanism
  that will get rid of old audio segments. Segments can also be pushed
  on a remote service we called `segmentforwarder`. Please note that this custom
  external service is not provided in this repository, but we can tell you it
  allows us to index those segments, build our HLS playlists, timeshift and push
  the segments to our CDN providers.

At Radio France we have many stations to stream. In this project, the Liquidsoap
configuration files are split in two. This separation allows us to industrialize
our station definitions:

- The `scripts/` folder contains a common set of Liquidsoap scripts that are
  reused for each station. You may see it as a versionned "template folder" or
  "app". When we bring changes to these configuration files all of our streams
  are impacted.

- Per station configuration is achieved in a another file, provided in the
  [start command](docker-compose.yml#L20) of the Liquidsoap process: for each
  stream we build, the `autofallback` SRT inputs, listening ports and output
  formats are defined in their own standalone file (see
  [myradio.liq](example/Liquidsoap/myradio.liq) for an complete example). You
  can see this as an inventory file. (To be honnest, we have so many stations to
  define we actually generate those files with an external templating tool)

In the common Liquidsoap configuration, [Prometheus](scripts/20-prometheus.liq)
metrics are created and exposed on a dedicated port, allowing the real time
monitoring of buffers, audio levels and SRT input state.

![Advanced implementation architecture](.res/advanced.png)

## Getting started

### Requirements

- `make`
- `docker`

### Start containers

```bash
make help
make start
```

You can safely press `ctrl+c` to stop displaying logs

### Checking service state

```
make status
make logs
```

### Listening

By default, the Liquidsoap main loop produces blank audio when nothing is fed
into the SRT input ports. It means that if Liquidsoap is started, you can
already listen to the blank stream using the Icecast URL or the HLS playlist.

In the following example we use `ffplay` as our audio player, but you could use
anything you want: a custom web player, mobile app, `vlc`, a native player
inside a browser, etc.

Listening URLs for the `myradio` example station are:

#### HLS

To listen to the [HLS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8216) adaptative
playlist:

```bash
ffplay http://localhost:8080/myradio/myradio.m3u8
# Use letter 'c' in the ffplay window to switch between playlists.
# Default playlist order with ffplay: lofi, midfi, hifi. You may experience a
# different order according to your player.
```

For convenience, playlists and HLS .ts segments can be browsed thanks to the
nginx server:

```
chrome http://localhost:8080/
```

#### Icecast

```bash
# AAC
## high quality
ffplay http://localhost:8000/myradio-hifi.aac

## mid quality
ffplay http://localhost:8000/myradio-midfi.aac

## low quality
ffplay http://localhost:8000/myradio-lofi.aac

# MP3
## mid quality
ffplay http://localhost:8000/myradio-midfi.mp3

## low quality
ffplay http://localhost:8000/myradio-lofi.mp3
```

### Using HTTP API

The HTTP API allows you to switch between sources or get information about the
output stream.

You can easily get current status:

```
$ curl -s localhost:7000/livesource
```

You will get the following response:

```
{
  "preferred_output": "voieA_caller1",
  "inputs": [
    "voieA_caller1",
    "voieA_caller2",
    "voieB_caller1",
    "voieB_caller2",
    "override_caller1",
    "override_caller2",
    "sat_sat1"
  ],
  "real_output": "safe_blank",
  "is_output_blank": true
}
```

`preferred_output` is the preferred SRT source that Liquidsoap will select to
build the output stream (highest priority input).

`real_output` is the real source currently used by Liquidsoap to build the
output stream. If the preferred livesource is unavailable, you can read here
which source Liquidsoap is currently using as a fallback.

`is_output_blank` is a boolean set to true when audio is blank (no sound).

To manually switch between SRT sources:

```
$ curl -s -d <input> http://localhost:7000/livesource
```

For example:

```
$ curl -s -d override_caller1 http://localhost:7000/livesource
{"preferred_output": "override_caller1"}
```

### Show default exposed URLs and useful ports

```
make info
```

### Sending audio to the streaming server with SRT

We provide examples in the containers prefixed with `source-`.

To send audio to the SRT source, you can use
[srt-live-transmit](https://github.com/Haivision/srt/blob/master/docs/apps/srt-live-transmit.md)
or `ffmpeg` compiled with [SRT](https://github.com/Haivision/srt)
support (Debian Bullseye `ffmpeg` or https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/ for
example).

You don't have to use a container:

```bash
# static file
ffmpeg -re -i $AUDIOFILE -vn -f wav -codec:a pcm_s16le srt://127.0.0.1:10001

# live stream
export LIVESTREAM='https://stream.radiofrance.fr/fip/fip_hifi.m3u8?id=Liquidsoap'
ffmpeg -re -i $LIVESTREAM -vn -f wav -codec:a pcm_s16le srt://127.0.0.1:10001
```

The port `:10001` should be modified to match the SRT input you want to use.
Each SRT input in the fallback loop has its own port.
